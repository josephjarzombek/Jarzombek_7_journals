What have you done?
I have finished the actual simon say part of the game, as well as wrote the lines i need to make the piezzo play the song i want to play after you win.
What do you need to do?
I still need to write the code for the servo that will make it rapidly spin back and forth, and probably tryy and see if I can still work the photoresistor in becasue it is so neat.
What will you be able to turn in on Friday?
Hopefully majority of the project as most of the code comes from other circiuts. 
What code changes are you writing?
I am writing the tune that will play at the end, as well as changing some of the speeds/ directions of the servo. I still have not decided what I want to try and code with the photoresistor
What functions have you created?
The only function that i needed to right was one that will play the winning song, which I then put in the win function.
