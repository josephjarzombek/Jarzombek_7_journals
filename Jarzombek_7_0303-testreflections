What did you miss?
I missed the array portion, and got the code for the getters and setters wrong.
What could you have done to have been more successful?
I could have read over the notes we took to better remember ho to write out getters and setters. Also the class constructor was probably not has fluid as it could have been and I made an array for the ints of slimeball not an array of slimeballs.
If you were successful - what was it that you did that made you successful? 
I was successful in my essay portion, but knowing the litrature of the code is not my strong suit.
