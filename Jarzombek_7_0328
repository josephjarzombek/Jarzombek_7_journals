What differences and similarities have you noticed?
Java is object-oriented, while C is function oriented.
the code commenting is the same.
For loops in Java and in C are the same.
What code adaptations have you made? 
I have done alot of experimenting with the photo resistor, such as making it work with a piezzo
buzzer, or haveing more speciffic amounts of light to pick up.
What is required for a circuit?
For a circuit, you need to have some sort of voltage, and a chain of conductive materials to 
allow the electrons to move in a circle. 
How are programs compiled with Arduino?
They are compiled using a highly advanced language called C. C is compiled and added to
the circuit board to tell the wires what to power and what to do specifically.
Describe the projects you have completed this/last week and what you have learned from 
them.
The projects that we created last week were circuits. They were made specifically to get
a certain output. For example, we created LED circuits, they had an LED on the breadboard
and the wires connected to the circuit board in specific places. Then, we just made
several different functions for the LED light. In one, we had a potentiometer to adjust
how often the LED would blink. I later moved on to more advanced work, I got to a game
called "Simon Says" and four LED's lit up and you would have to press the corresponding
button. Every time you got it correct, it would add on more rythms/patterns. I have
learned to first unplug all of the cords before I begin to use a circuit board, and other
general things with wireing such as making sure the ground is in the right order and the 
importants of resistors.
