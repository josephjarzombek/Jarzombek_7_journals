1. How do we make a class? What code comes at the beginning?
public class Joy{
  codey code stuff;
}
2. Donut Bismarck = new Donut();
is this a class constructor?
No. A class constructor is a method in a class that allows you to set the variable of that class. This is how you make instances.
This uses a class constructor.
3. How do we make a class with values and a class constructor?
public class Donut{
 int x, y;
 boolean isGlazed;
 boolean hasJelly;
 float temperature;
 public Donut (boolean a, boolean b, float c){
  this.isGlazed = a;
  this.hasJelly = b;
  this.temperature = c;
}
  //a getter gets, i.e. , a getter returns a variable value.
  public boolean getHasJelly(){
    return this.hasJelly;
  }
  public void setTemperature(float c){
  this.temperature = c;
}
    
Add values, add class constructor.
4. Explain in your own words - what is a getter? what does it do?
a getter gets, i.e. , a getter returns a variable value. Usaually a getter is a public method to get a private value.

5. What is a setter? what does it do? Give an example.
