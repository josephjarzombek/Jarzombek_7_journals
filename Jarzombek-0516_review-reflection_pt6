Explain casting, up-casting, down-casting.
Up-casting puts an object in a certain group, but the object itself continues to act as its own object.
Down-casting allows the objects to seperate from a certain grouping allowing the properties of that object to be manipulated once more.
Casting is taking an object of one certain type and turning it into another object type.

Give a specific code example for up-casting.
Thing t = new Cathing();
    System.out.println(c);
    Item i= t; // upcasting
    System.out.println(i);

Give a specific code example for down-casting.
Thing t1 = new Thing();		 
    Being b = t1;		
    if(a instanceof Thing){ 
        System.out.println("This is a thing so i can downcast to a thing.");        
        Thing t2 = (Thing)b;
    }

Give a specific code example for converting a char to a String.
String stringValueOf = String.valueOf('c');

What is the range of values for byte? Why?
-128 to 127. Unsigned 128 is 10000000. Negative integers are represented in a system called two's complement.
