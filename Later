Explain this code:
public Animation Playeranime, up, down, left, right, sprite, wait;
    public Player() throws SlickException {
        SpriteSheet runningSS = new SpriteSheet(
                "res/ogrespritesheet.png", 64, 64, 0);
        up = new Animation();
        up.setAutoUpdate(true);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(0, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(1, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(2, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(3, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(4, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(5, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(6, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(7, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(8, 8), 330);
This is what makes the character move in an animated way while the character is idle.
Why would it be unrealistic / unproductive  to memorize Slick syntax - what are the skills we were trying to practice?
There are way to many syntax lines, and slick is hardly used in the real world, we are just using it to practice. We are Trying to practice reasoning and problem solving with slightly limited information
