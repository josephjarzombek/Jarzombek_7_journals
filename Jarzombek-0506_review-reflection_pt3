Given mymap[67][43], Which is the X coordinate? How does this happen?
43 is the X coordinate, and 67 is the Y coordinate. The array is setup so that the y is first and the x is second.

Write the code from line a and explain what it does.
	if(i == 0) {
	System.out.print("8888");
}

This line of code checks to see if the y value is 0, and if it is, it will the border.

This line of code will print the same thing as c, but it will go to a new line.

Explain how to use a boolean with a while loop. Provide a very specific use case and
code example.

somewhere in this loop then the game will run until that circumstance is met and it ends.

Explain the use of static.
