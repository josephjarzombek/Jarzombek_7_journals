The essence of human / higher level learning is developing the skill to discriminate
patterns and identify shared characteristics across events (stimuli). Memorization, the
regurgitation of facts, is considered the lowest level of learning. Why, then, are
students encouraged to learn computer science?

Students are encouraged to learn computer science because it is a enhanced way of learning how to teach ourselves things. It teaches us that we need to tinker with things and that we need to work on our own to solve our problems.

What should students learn from computer science?

Goggle can't solve all your problems, you actually need to think things throgh. CS  helps because it is something with a wide variety of mediums to learn.
